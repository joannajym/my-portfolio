            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              <i>The Weathered Game of Oz</i> is a simulation that extends the classic <strong>"Land of Oz" Markov chain weather model</strong>. The original model
              simulates weather patterns (Sunny, Rainy, Snowy) using fixed transition probabilities. This project introduces the impacts
              of <strong>urbanisation</strong> and <strong>deforestation</strong> on weather variability and regional socio-economic outcomes. 
            </p><br></br>
            <p>
              The simulation uses a transition matrix influenced by human activity and integrates <strong>Gillespie Algorithms</strong>, <strong>Monte Carlo Simulations</strong>, 
              and <strong>Game Theory</strong> to explore: (1) how human development alters weather over time, and (2) how different regions adapt to these changes via strategic
              decision-making. Key outcomes include weather pattern evolution, agriculture and trade analysis, and migration policy strategies using Nash equilibrium.

            <h3>Modelling Questions</h3>
            <p>
              The project was designed to answer two central research questions:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. How do human activities like urbanisation and deforestation influence weather patterns in the Land of Oz over time?
            </p>
            <p>
              2. How do these changing weather patterns affect the socio-economic status?

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Working on this project really opened my eyes to how interconnected our world is. What started as a simple extension of the classic weather model turned into something much more complex. I discovered that when we change the environment through urbanisation and deforestation, we're not just affecting the weather, we're completely changing how regions need to think about survival and cooperation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most surprising result was that <strong>migration management</strong> kept coming up as the best strategy for everyone. I ran thousands of simulations using Monte Carlo methods, and every time, the game theory analysis showed that managing population movement was more important than trying to optimise agriculture or trade. It makes sense when you think about it. If the weather becomes unpredictable, people need to be able to move to where conditions are better, rather than being stuck in one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project made me realize how relevant these concepts are to real-world challenges like climate change and urban planning. The findings suggest that instead of focusing on rigid policies, we should be building flexible systems that can adapt as conditions change. It's fascinating how a simple weather simulation can reveal insights about human behavior and policy-making that could actually help communities become more resilient in the face of environmental uncertainty.
