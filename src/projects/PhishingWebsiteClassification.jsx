            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This project was developed for my Data Analytics coursework to gain practical experience with <strong>machine learning classification</strong> techniques 
              and <strong>cybersecurity</strong> applications. The aim was to build and compare multiple supervised learning models to accurately identify and classify 
              phishing websites, which pose significant threats to online security and user privacy.
            </p><br></br>
            <p>
              Using a comprehensive dataset of website features, I implemented and evaluated several machine learning algorithms including <strong>Decision Trees, 
              Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes</strong>. The project focused on feature engineering, model selection, and performance 
              evaluation to determine the most effective approach for phishing detection.
            </p><br></br>
            <p>
              The analysis included detailed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess each model's 
              performance. This project demonstrates practical application of machine learning in cybersecurity and provides insights into the effectiveness 
              of different classification approaches for detecting malicious websites.
